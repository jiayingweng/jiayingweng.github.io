I am an Assistant Professor of [Mathematical Sciences at Bentley University](https://faculty.bentley.edu/profile/jweng). Prior to joining Bentley, I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Kentucky under the supervision of Dr. Xiangrong Yin.


# Research
My primary research interests encompass sufficient dimension reduction, variable selection, and high-dimensional data analysis. Sufficient dimension reduction is a statistical technique that aims to find a low-dimensional representation of the predictor variables while preserving the information about the response variable.
